# Monorepo

This is a _monorepo_ powered by [turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs) split into the following:

- [`apps/`](./apps/):
  - [`www/`](./apps/www/): The primary web app showcasing some of the features, built with Next.js
  - [`docs/`](./apps/docs/): The documentation site, built with [Nextra](https://nextra.site/docs)
- [`examples/`](./examples/): A folder to showcase example apps - such as chatbots etc.
- [`packages/`](./packages/):
  - [`cli/`](./packages/cli/): The npm package that gets published to npm, making it possible to run `npx shadcn-chat-cli add`
  - [`ui/`](./packages/ui/): This package is used as a shared ui dependency package in the `www` and `docs`.

# semantic-release

This project uses [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) to automate version management and package publishing on npm.

When changes are made to specific paths in the repository on a pull request, a GitHub action determines whether to trigger a `patch`, `minor`, or `major` release.

Paths Monitored for Changes:

- `'apps/www/public/registry/index.json'`
- `'packages/cli/\*\*'`
- `'packages/ui/**'`

To ensure proper versioning, follow the [commit message formats](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release?tab=readme-ov-file#commit-message-format) when making changes to the chat components. If you're unsure, avoid prefixing your commit message with any of the semantic keywords (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `BREAKING CHANGE:`).

# How the project works

## CLI package overview

The [cli](./packages/cli/) package is a command-line tool that fetches components from a registry. This registry is a JSON file containing metadata about available components, such as their `names`, `dependencies`, `files`, and `types`. The registry is hosted on the [web app](https://shadcn-chat.vercel.app) and can be found at [here](apps/www/public/registry/index.json).

## Registry structure

Each component in the registry includes the following fields, which are used by the cli tool to install them:

- `name`: The name of the component.
- `dependencies`: A list of other components it depends on.
- `files`: The files that make up the component (e.g., `.tsx`, `.ts`).
- `type`: The type of component (e.g., `components:ui` or `hooks`).

## Development workflow

### **Making Changes to Chat Components**

All chat components are maintained in the **shared UI package** (`packages/ui/src/components/ui/chat`). Follow these steps to make changes:

1. **Navigate to the Shared UI Package**:
   ```bash
   cd packages/ui
   ```
2. **Make your changes**:
   - Edit the components in the `src/components/ui/chat` directory, or create new ones
   - For example, update the `ChatBubble` component in `src/components/ui/chat/ChatBubble.tsx`.
3. **Rebuild the Shared UI Package:**
   - After making changes, rebuild the package to ensure the updates are reflected:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   - You can now import the components in the frontend (`www` or `docs`):
   ```tsx
   import { ChatBubble } from "@shadcn-chat/ui";
   ```
4. **Test Your Changes Locally:**
   - Start the dev server by changing directory to the root folder and run
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   - Verify the changes are applied correctly
5. **Update the registry**
   - If youâ€™ve added or modified components, regenerate the registry to update the metadata, by changing directory to the root folder and run
   ```bash
   npm run generate-registry
   ```

### **Testing the CLI in Development Mode**

To test your newly generated registry changes locally with the `npx` command, do the following:

1. **Navigate to the CLI Package:**
   ```bash
   cd packages/cli
   ```
2. **Run the CLI in Development Mode:**
   Use the `start:dev` script to run the CLI with a local registry:
   ```bash
   npm run start:dev add
   ```
3. **Check the file(s)**:
   The above will add the files to a `packages/cli/src/components/ui/chat` folder. This is just to test, if the CLI command works as expected.

   **Make sure to check if the files are correct, and then delete them after!**
