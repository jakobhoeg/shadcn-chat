# Monorepo

This is a _monorepo_ powered by [turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs) split into the following:

- [`apps/`](./apps/):
  - [`www/`](./apps/www/): The primary web app showcasing some of the features, built with Next.js
  - [`docs/`](./apps/docs/): The documentation site, built with [Nextra](https://nextra.site/docs)
- [`examples/`](./examples/): A folder to showcase example apps - such as chatbots etc.
- [`packages/`](./packages/):
  - [`cli/`](./packages/cli/): The npm package that gets published to npm.

# semantic-release

This project uses [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) to automate version management and package publishing on npm.

When changes are made to specific paths in the repository on a pull request, a GitHub action determines whether to trigger a `patch`, `minor`, or `major` release.

Paths Monitored for Changes:

- `'apps/www/public/registry/index.json'`
- `'packages/cli/\*\*'`

To ensure proper versioning, follow the [commit message formats](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release?tab=readme-ov-file#commit-message-format) when making changes. If you're unsure, avoid prefixing your commit message with any of the semantic keywords (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `BREAKING CHANGE:`).

# How the package works

The [cli](./packages/cli/) package is a command-line tool that fetches components from a registry. This registry is a JSON file containing metadata about available components, such as their `names`, `dependencies`, `files`, and `types`. The registry is hosted on the [web app](https://shadcn-chat.vercel.app) and can be found at [here](apps/www/public/registry/index.json).

Each component in the registry has:

- `name`: The name of the component.
- `dependencies`: A list of other components it depends on.
- `files`: The files that make up the component (e.g., `.tsx`, `.ts`).
- `type`: The type of component (e.g., `components:ui` or `hooks`).

### Development workflow

The components from `/apps/www/src/components/ui/chat` are the ones being used atm. Ideally, we'd make a shared UI library to

- Local Development:

  - Navigate to

  - The CLI can be run in development mode by changing directory to `packages/cli` and using `npm run start:dev`, which uses a local registry URL (`http://localhost:3000/registry/index.json`), so you can install the components from your local environment for testing.

To generate the registry after making changes to any of the components inside
